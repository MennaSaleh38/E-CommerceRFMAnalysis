This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

I have performed a full analysis using both python and power BI:

Data Cleaning and Explortary Analysis using python.
Performing RFM analysis and cstomer segmentation using python as well.
Lastly,  creating a dashboard with visuals and numbers to have a better outlook on different customer segments and the business using PowerBI.
